# Product Space calculations

## Done:
- rca (and fair share)
- proximity
- density
- distance

## TODO:
- complexity (returns geo and product complexity)
- opportunity gain (requires pci from complexity (product complexity))
- mhat (requires stats module)
- rca confidence (requires stats module)

## Future work:
- better docs for calculations, relate the paper and formulas to the code
- serializing to json (maybe csv)
- create workspace
- product space calc server
